# The index class is used to represent a tensor index.
#
# An index consists of three parts:  a name, a list of types, and a bool.
#
# The index's name may be any string.
#
# The bool indicates whether the index is summed over or otherwise is a dummy
# index whose name may be changed.
# A value of True means that the various operator algebra functions are allowed
# the change the index's name as they wish.
# A value of False means that the index's name may not be changed.
#
# The list of types is actually a list of lists of strings.
# Each list of strings represents a type group.
# Examples of type groups are the index's spin type or whether the index is 
# core, active, virtual, etc.
# The reason for this format is to evaluate Kronecker delta functions, which will
# evaluate to zero if there is no overlap in any of the two indices' type groups.
# For example, if index1 has indexType = [['alpha'], ['core', 'active']] and
# index2 has indexType = [['beta'], ['active']], the Kronecker delta between them
# will be zero because the first type group has no matching strings.
# If the first type group had been omitted, then the delta function would not be
# zero because both indices have 'active' as one of the types in the second type group.
# Note that while the type groups can be inputted as a list of lists of strings, they
# are actually stored as a tuple of tuples of strings.

# Modified by M. Saitow May 16, 2012, isExt flag and __hash__ are added
